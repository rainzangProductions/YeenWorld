- By 3am on the 2nd: Disabled gravity for the jelk projectile and added detection for physical impacts.
All projectiles, if they explode, now explode upon impact instead of just waiting for the delay to run out.
This also includes adding explosion impacts to any rigidbodies EXCLUDING other projectiles
- Increased sight range and attack range of my test enemies so the player has more time to react
to oncoming projectiles

- Edited the code so that enemy projectiles (at least grenades) are actually pointed forward

19 December 2025 2:45am
- Created the PlayerHealth script
- Created the different attack types as an enum in EnemyAI (instead of memorizing a list of attack types and assigning them a number)
- When an enemy creates a projectile, it sets the ""enemyOwner" of the grenadeExplosion script to itself, so the player knows "alright this splash damage?
was created by this projectile which was created by this enemy which does XYZ damage, so I will now take XYZ damage"

- Finished the MasterUITextAssetGetter script. It reads from files that have the translations for the UI in a singular text file :)
- Lowered the pixel per resolution of the dialogue box and the buttons for "save" and "quit" to make them rounded at the edges

November 4 2025 2am
- Used ChatGPT to come up with a script that separates on the same line in TextAssets using the comma "," so I could make one text file per UI element and have it be in
multiple languages. IE "EN,Interact" and then "DE,Sprechen" on another line. Copied and pasted from chatgpt and it worked like a charm yippee
- Changed the opacity of the E2Interact textbox from 22 to 130
- Fixed the spacing of the textbox to accomodate for the word "Interagieren"
- Moved the textbox panel slightly lower and made it less tall
- Started creation of MasterUITextAssetGetter

October 31 2025
- Dialogue can now be parsed through text files. Kept in subfolders designated for the game's respective language enabling the game to be translated/localized
- The player is opaque when moving around so the player can see who they're looking/shooting. Goes fully colored when idling.
